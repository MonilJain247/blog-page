                <p>Core concepts
                    Learning from data: ML models find patterns and correlations in large datasets to make predictions or decisions.
                    AI subset: Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on teaching machines to learn from experience.
                    Continuous improvement: Models become more accurate as they are exposed to more data.</p>

            <p><b>Machine learning</b>is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.
